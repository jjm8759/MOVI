This folder contains definitions of the project's mongoose schema and models for use in the MongoDB cluster.

A schema defines the structure of your collection documents. 
A Mongoose schema maps directly to a MongoDB collection.

Models take your schema and apply it to each document in its collection.
Models are responsible for all document interactions like creating, 
reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD).
